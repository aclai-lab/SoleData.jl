With such formulas, scalar one-step optimization can be performed.\n\nFor example, checking ⟨R⟩(MyFeature ≥ 10) on a world w of a Kripke structure involves comparing the maximum MyFeature across ws accessible worlds with 10; but the same maximum value can be reused to check sibling formulas such as ⟨R⟩(MyFeature ≥ 100). This sparks the idea of storing and reusing scalar aggregations (e.g., minimum/maximum) over the feature values. Each value refers to a specific world, and an object of type ⟨R⟩(f ⋈ ?), called a \"scalar metacondition\".\n\nSimilar cases arise depending on the relation and the test operator (or, better, its aggregator), and further optimizations can be applied for specific feature types (see representatives).\n\nAn immediate special case, however, arises when R is the global relation G since, in such case, a single aggregate value is enough for all worlds within the Kripke structure. Therefore, we differentiate between generic, relational memosets (see AbstractScalarOneStepRelationalMemoset), and global memosets (see AbstractScalarOneStepGlobalMemoset), which are usually much smaller.\n\nGiven a logiset X, a ScalarOneStepMemoset covers a set of relations and metaconditions, and it holds both a relational and a global memoset.
