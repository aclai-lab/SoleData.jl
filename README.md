## In a nutshell

*SoleData* provides a **machine learning oriented** data layer on top of DataFrames.jl/Tables.jl for:
- Instantiating and manipulating [*multimodal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning) datasets for (un)supervised machine learning;
- Dealing with [*(un)structured* data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data) (e.g., graphs, images, time-series, etc.);
- Describing datasets via basic statistical measures;
- Saving to/loading from *npy/npz* format, as well as a custom CSV-based format (with interesting features such as *lazy loading* of datasets);
- Performing basic data processing operations (e.g., windowing, moving average, etc.).

If you are used to dealing with unstructured/multimodal data, but cannot find the right
tools in Julia, you will find
[*SoleFeatures.jl*](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleFeatures.jl/) useful!

## About

The package is developed by the [ACLAI Lab](https://aclai.unife.it/en/) @ University of
Ferrara.

*SoleData.jl* was originally built as the data layer for
[*Sole.jl*](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl), an open-source framework for
*symbolic machine learning*.
